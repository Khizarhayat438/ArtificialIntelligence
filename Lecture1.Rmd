Solving: International Edition by George F. Luger, 6 th edition: Pearson
Education, 2008.
2. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Stuart Jonathan Russell,

## List of Definitions:
1. "The exciting new effort to make computers think (machines with minds), in the full and literal sense." (Haugeland, 1985)
2. "[The automation of] activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning . . ." (Bellman, 1978) 
3. "The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence
when performed by people." (Kurzweil,1990)
4. "The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better." (Rich and Knight, 1991)
5. "The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models."(Chamiak and McDermott, 1985)
6. "The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act."(Winston, 1992)
7. "Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents." (Poole et al., 1998)
8. "A1 . . .is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts." (Nilsson, 1998)

col2 <- c("Systems that think rationally", "Definitions 5 and 6", "Systems that act rationally", "Definition 7 and 8")
txttable <- data.frame(col1, col2)
x = kable(txttable, "html") %>% 
                   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
                   column_spec(1, border_right = T) %>%
                   row_spec(1, bold=T) %>% row_spec(3, bold = T)
gsub("<thead>.*</thead>", "", x)
```

Definitions of Artificial Intelligence(A.I) vary along two main dimensions:

1. Thought process and reasoning
2. behavior 

Historically all four approaches to A.I have been followed.

## Acting humanly: The Turing Approach

Alan Turing suggested a test based on **indistinguishability from human beings**. The computer passes
the test if a human iterrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the
written responses come from a person or not. (for movie lovers [The Imitation Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/))

To pass the test the computer would need following capabilities:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): to successfully communicate in English.
- Knowledge representation: to store what it knows or hears.
- Automated reasoning: to answer questions using stored information and draw new conclusion
- machine learning: to adapt new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate new patterns.

### Total Turing Test
Total Turing test allows the interrogator to pass physical objects to test perceptual abilities. To pass the total turing test the computer will need:

- computer vision: to perceive objects, and 
- robotics to manipulate objects and move about.

## Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
To say that a given program thinks like human, we must have some way of determining **how humans think**. There are two ways to do this, through introspection, and through psychological experiments.
