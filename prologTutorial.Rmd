# Facts, Rules and Queries

There are 3 basic constructs in Prolog: 

1. Facts
2. Rules
3. Queries

* A collection of _Rules_ and _Facts_ is called a _knowledge base_ (or a database) and Prolog programming is all about writing knowledge bases.

* We use prolog programs by posing _queries_ (by asking questions about the information stored)
